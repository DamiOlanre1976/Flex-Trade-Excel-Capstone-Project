## 📌 Key Insights

1. **Longer Sessions Correlate with Higher Conversion**  
   Users who stay longer tend to convert more often. Suggests content engagement is high.

2. **High Drop-Off During Checkout**  
   A steep decline in conversions happens at 26–50% completion, indicating a possible UX/design issue at that stage.

3. **Positive Feedback Drives Engagement**  
   Sessions with positive sentiment have higher durations and conversion potential.

4. **Customer Support Feedback Yields Best Outcomes**  
   Feedback submitted via *Customer Support* has the highest conversion rate.

5. **Page Views Influence Bounce Rate**  
   Sessions with fewer than 4 page views are most likely to bounce. Retention mechanisms need improvement.

6. **Product View Threshold Identified**  
   The optimal number of product views before conversion is 6–10. Beyond that, conversions dip, suggesting *over-exploration fatigue*.

## ✅ Recommendations

1. **Fix Checkout Flow Between 25–50%**  
   Optimize loading speed, input forms, and visual hierarchy at the middle stage of checkout to reduce abandonment.

   After 10 product views, begin showing *smart recommendations* or offer filters to prevent decision fatigue.

5. **Engage Early Bouncers**  
   Introduce onboarding popups or tutorials for users who view <4 pages to reduce bounce rate.
